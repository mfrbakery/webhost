"Hey," they'd say. "Hot new laptop coming out! It's got that new Wi-Fi!" An early version of the laptop would arrive at the title's office and someone would write a detailed review of it because, let's face it, there was little else to do at the office before the Internet was pervasive. Then, two months later the story would go to press and then maybe end up on some nascent Internet CMS hacked together by a designer after hours. The circle of life, then, for a tech product was about half a year.

Albinus wants job seekers to build their profiles on Revl, which is coming out of beta today. Obviously, many people already do that on LinkedIn, but Albinus argued that the existing site mostly serves older, white-collar workers. He pointed to <a target="_blank" href="http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/08/21/report-social-network-demographics-in-2012/">a Royal Pingdom report</a> which found that 79 percent of LinkedIn users are 35 or older (compared to 65 percent for Facebook and 55 for Twitter).
