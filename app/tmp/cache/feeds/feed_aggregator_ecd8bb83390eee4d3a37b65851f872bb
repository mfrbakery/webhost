I'm not so sure this is the best thing in the world, as you don't have an option to turn it off. I like the idea of inviting people to share their thoughts, and mixing in real names and pictures if chosen by the user. That way, you know what reviews you might want to trust over other ones that are anonymous.";s:6:"source";s:11:"Tech Crunch";}s:31:"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 06:41:41 +0000";a:6:{s:5:"title";s:71:"STEM Ed: CodeHS Wants To Teach Every American High Schooler How To Code";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://techcrunch.com/?p=703326";s:4:"date";s:31:"Tue, 27 Nov 2012 06:41:41 +0000";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/uXY2-tAzAyo/";s:11:"description";s:682:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/logo2.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="logo" title="logo" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />In the Silicon Valley Distortion Field, it can seem like everyone is learning to code -- that coding has become cool.
