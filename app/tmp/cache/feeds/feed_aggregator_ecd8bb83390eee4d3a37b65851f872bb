I mentioned in that piece that the company was hiring a variety of interesting positions. Today, Williams announced a new addition, a Director of Content.

The new hire, Kate Lee, is a former literary agent at International Creative Management (ICM).";s:6:"source";s:11:"Tech Crunch";}s:31:"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 05:43:52 +0000";a:6:{s:5:"title";s:117:"Presentz and Mozilla’s Popcorn: 2 Platforms For Creating Video Slide Shows From Vimeo, YouTube, SlideShare And More";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://techcrunch.com/?p=700343";s:4:"date";s:31:"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 05:43:52 +0000";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/40DhwbxCs-Q/";s:11:"description";s:2311:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/presentzmaker2.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="PresentzMaker2" title="PresentzMaker2" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />The era of connected data services continues to unfold with the advent of emerging platforms such as Presentz, an open-source slide show offering for people to mashup videos, images and other media from YouTube, Vimeo, SlideShare and other providers. The service syncs video with a slide deck so people can follow a recorded conference talk and see the slides at the same time. Presentz has been in development for more than a year but recently has had more attention. This is in part due to the breadth of applications available that can be mashed up and the realization that it&#8217;s unncessary to load all your data onto one platform and use the tools that the vendor provides. Plus, it&#8217;s free to use and open-source. At the heart of Presentz is the open-source JavaScript library that syncs the video and the slides. Users add links to their videos and slide decks to the form on the Presentz website. It supports YouTube and Vimeo for video. SlideShare, LibreOffice and SpeakerDeck are the slide-show presentation services that a user can pull. The video and slides render to the site. Here I&#8217;ve pulled an unrelated video and slide deck together to show how Presentz works. Here&#8217;s how it looks when finished: Most alternatives to Presentz have a centralized approach: you give them your video or audio and slides, you use their tools to mix them, and they will publish and host the result. Presentz just pulls the video and slides from third parties. Presentz is similar to Mozilla&#8217;s PopcornMaker, which is richer in scope but not as focused as what you get with Presentz. Mozilla describes Popcorn as a platform to enhance, remix and share web video. It&#8217;s a browser-based platform with the capability to combine video and audio with text, links, maps, pictures and live feeds. The biggest difference between Presentz and Popcorn are the use cases. Popcorn is a remix servicw that it describes as a storytelling platform. Presentz is best for conferences and presentations. Both are worth a look.";s:6:"source";s:11:"Tech Crunch";}s:31:"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 04:08:54 +0000";a:6:{s:5:"title";s:92:"Review: Amazon Is Gunning For Every Other Tablet Out There With The New Kindle Fire 8.9-Inch";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://techcrunch.com/?p=702268";s:4:"date";s:31:"Tue, 20 Nov 2012 04:08:54 +0000";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/hk0m5eo3xuo/";s:11:"description";s:1015:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/scaledwm-img_1136.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="scaledwm.IMG_1136" title="scaledwm.IMG_1136" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />Amazon and Barnes &#38; Noble have always been good at building portable reading devices.

This large tablet is so big that I'd be loath to call it an ereader at all but rather a fairly inexpensive, all-in-one device aimed as sort of a "second tablet" in a home that may already have a number of these sorts of devices lying about.

Nobody likes to think about five developers locked in a room somewhere, coding until they pass out. Yes, I know that's the reality for many young startups, but as they grow up into larger companies, things change.

For a company like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/15/twitter-breathes-more-life-and-context-into-discover-with-media-first-headlines-and-more/">Twitter</a>, one of the ways things have changed is that members of its teams go out once in a while on a Friday for "Friday For Good" day.

I wanted to try out Microsoft’s new device because I like testing all new devices, ensuring that I maintain a good sense of the overall landscape. Plus, I find it fascinating that Microsoft is now doing their own Windows-based hardware. It’s nothing if not exciting. Can they pull it off?

Unfortunately, it proved harder than I imagined to get my hands on a device. While at first, a few people got back to me offering to either give me or show me a Surface immediately, Microsoft quickly laid the hammer down. From my understanding, one such order even came down from a certain recently-departed executive’s office.";s:6:"source";s:11:"Tech Crunch";}s:31:"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 20:22:11 +0000";a:6:{s:5:"title";s:41:"Are Humans Or Robots More Moral Soldiers?";s:4:"guid";s:31:"http://techcrunch.com/?p=702226";s:4:"date";s:31:"Mon, 19 Nov 2012 20:22:11 +0000";s:4:"link";s:57:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/TEDYcdxAaQI/";s:11:"description";s:1209:"<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/term_1123791c.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="Term_1123791c" title="Term_1123791c" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" />"Giving machines the power to decide who lives and dies on the battlefield would take technology too far," <a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/nov/19/killer-robots-banned-human-rights">said</a> Steve Goose, arms division director of Human Rights Watch, which just released on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hrw.org/reports/2012/11/19/losing-humanity-0">ominous new proposal</a> to ban fully-automatic robots from war.
